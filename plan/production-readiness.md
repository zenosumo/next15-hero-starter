# Production Readiness Plan

This plan outlines all necessary steps to prepare the application for production deployment.

## Phase 1: Cleanup & Optimization ðŸ§¹

### 1. Audit and Remove Unused Files
- [ ] Scan for unused components in `/src/components`
- [ ] Remove development-only files and test artifacts
- [ ] Clean up unused assets in `/public`
- [ ] Remove any temporary or backup files
- [ ] Check for unused imports across all files

### 2. HeroUI Dependencies Optimization
- [ ] Analyze current HeroUI usage with bundle analyzer
- [ ] Identify unused HeroUI components
- [ ] Optimize imports to only include used components
- [ ] Review and potentially tree-shake:
  - `@heroui/react` - ensure only used components are imported
  - `@heroui/system` - check if still needed after provider fix
  - `@heroui/theme` - verify theme customizations are necessary
- [ ] Test that all UI functionality still works after optimization

### 3. Tailwind CSS Configuration Review
- [ ] Verify `content` paths in `tailwind.config.mjs` are accurate
- [ ] Ensure unused CSS is properly purged in production builds
- [ ] Review custom theme extensions for necessity
- [ ] Optimize font loading and CSS variables

## Phase 2: Security & Performance ðŸ”’

### 4. API Security Audit
- [ ] Review all API routes in `/src/app/api` (if any exist)
- [ ] Implement proper authentication and authorization
- [ ] Validate input sanitization and validation
- [ ] Check for SQL injection vulnerabilities
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for API endpoints
- [ ] Ensure sensitive data is not exposed in client-side code
- [ ] Review CORS configuration

### 5. Environment Variables & Secrets
- [ ] Audit all environment variables
- [ ] Ensure production secrets are properly configured
- [ ] Remove any hardcoded API keys or sensitive data
- [ ] Set up proper environment variable validation
- [ ] Configure different environments (dev, staging, prod)

### 6. Bundle Size & Performance Optimization
- [ ] Run `npm run build` and analyze bundle size
- [ ] Set up bundle analyzer (`npm install --save-dev @next/bundle-analyzer`)
- [ ] Implement code splitting for large components
- [ ] Add lazy loading for non-critical components
- [ ] Optimize images and static assets
- [ ] Review and optimize third-party dependencies

## Phase 3: Production Build & Testing ðŸš€

### 7. Production Build Testing
- [ ] Test `npm run build` completes without errors
- [ ] Test `npm run start` serves the app correctly
- [ ] Verify all routes work in production build
- [ ] Test navigation with HeroUI routing system
- [ ] Check that all environment variables are loaded correctly
- [ ] Verify static asset serving

### 8. Error Handling & Logging
- [ ] Implement global error boundaries
- [ ] Set up proper error logging (consider services like Sentry)
- [ ] Create custom 404 and 500 error pages
- [ ] Implement graceful degradation for failed API calls
- [ ] Add proper loading states and error messages

### 9. SEO & Metadata Optimization
- [ ] Verify `metadata` objects in all `layout.tsx` and `page.tsx` files
- [ ] Add proper Open Graph tags
- [ ] Create and configure `robots.txt`
- [ ] Set up `sitemap.xml`
- [ ] Verify proper heading hierarchy (h1, h2, h3)
- [ ] Add structured data markup where appropriate

## Phase 4: Monitoring & Analytics ðŸ“Š

### 10. Production Monitoring Setup
- [ ] Set up performance monitoring (Core Web Vitals)
- [ ] Configure analytics (Google Analytics, Plausible, etc.)
- [ ] Implement error tracking and monitoring
- [ ] Set up uptime monitoring
- [ ] Configure performance budgets and alerts

## Pre-Deployment Checklist âœ…

### Code Quality
- [ ] Run `npm run lint` and fix all issues
- [ ] Ensure TypeScript compilation passes without errors
- [ ] Review all TODO comments and resolve critical ones
- [ ] Code review completed

### Configuration
- [ ] Production environment variables configured
- [ ] Database connections tested (if applicable)
- [ ] CDN and static asset delivery configured
- [ ] SSL certificates configured
- [ ] Domain DNS properly configured

### Performance
- [ ] Lighthouse score > 90 for performance
- [ ] Bundle size under acceptable limits
- [ ] Images optimized and properly sized
- [ ] Core Web Vitals within acceptable ranges

### Security
- [ ] Security headers configured
- [ ] HTTPS enforced
- [ ] API endpoints secured
- [ ] Sensitive data not exposed in client bundle
- [ ] Dependencies audited for vulnerabilities (`npm audit`)

## Post-Deployment Tasks ðŸ”„

### Immediate
- [ ] Verify deployment successful
- [ ] Test critical user paths
- [ ] Monitor error logs for first 24 hours
- [ ] Check analytics and monitoring setup

### Ongoing
- [ ] Set up automated security updates
- [ ] Regular dependency updates
- [ ] Performance monitoring reviews
- [ ] User feedback collection and analysis

## Commands Reference

```bash
